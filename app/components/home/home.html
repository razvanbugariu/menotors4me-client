		The project is made for local mentors (teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs, etc.) and educational institutions (schools, high-schools, universities, etc.) to put them in contact, for a change of knowledge. There is a list with mentors from which a school can choose one of them and invite him or her to give them a lesson about a subject that the mentor has knowledge (like biology, computer science, literature, etc.).</p>
